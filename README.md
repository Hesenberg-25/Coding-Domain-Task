## About

This section covers the basics of Git and GitHub. The objective of this task was to understand how version control works and how code can be managed, tracked, and shared using Git and GitHub.

## What I Learned

1. Git is a Version-Control software used to Track Changes made to Code.
2. GitHub is a Web-Based platform used to host Git Repo online.
3. Changes in code are saved in the form of Commits, which store When and What and When changes were made.

## Commands Practiced

- git clone  
- git status  
- git add  
- git commit  
- git push  
- git pull  
- git branch  
- git checkout  
- git log  
- git reset  

## Conclusion

1. This task helped me understand how developers manage code versions and collaborate using Git and GitHub.
2. Working in the terminal using Git commands was a new and valuable learning experience.
